We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 
- [Terraform 1.5.3](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-vpn/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "vpn" {
      source                   = "clouddrove/vpn/aws"
      version                  = "2.0.0"

      name                                      = local.name
      environment                               = local.environment
      vpc_id                                    = module.vpc.vpc_id
      customer_ip_address                       = "115.160.246.74"
      local_ipv4_network_cidr                   = "0.0.0.0/0"
      remote_ipv4_network_cidr                  = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
      vpn_connection_static_routes_destinations = ["10.80.1.0/24"]
  }
```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
