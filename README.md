We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-vpn/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ```hcl
  module "vpn" {
      source              = "clouddrove/vpn/aws"
      version             = "1.0.1"
      name                = "vpn"
      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name"]
      vpc_id              = "vpc-xxxxxxxxxx"
      customer_ip_address = "115.160.246.74"
    }
  ```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| application | Application (e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| certificate\_arn | certificate\_arn (e.g. ''). | `string` | `""` | no |
| customer\_ip\_address | The IP of the Customer Gateway. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enable\_vpn\_connection | Set to false to prevent the creation of a VPN Connection. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_vpn\_gateway\_attachment | Set to false to prevent attachment of the vGW to the VPC. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| local\_ipv4\_network\_cidr | n/a | `string` | `"0.0.0.0/0"` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' or 'AnmolNagpal'. | `string` | `"anmol@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| remote\_ipv4\_network\_cidr | n/a | `string` | `"0.0.0.0/0"` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| tunnel1\_inside\_cidr | The CIDR block of the inside IP addresses for the first VPN tunnel. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tunnel1\_preshared\_key | The preshared key of the first VPN tunnel. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tunnel2\_inside\_cidr | The CIDR block of the inside IP addresses for the second VPN tunnel. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tunnel2\_preshared\_key | The preshared key of the second VPN tunnel. | `string` | `""` | no |
| vpc\_id | The id of the VPC where the VPN Gateway lives. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| vpc\_subnet\_route\_table\_count | The number of subnet route table ids being passed in via `vpc_subnet_route_table_ids`. | `string` | `0` | no |
| vpc\_subnet\_route\_table\_ids | The ids of the VPC subnets for which routes from the VPN Gateway will be propagated. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| vpn\_connection\_static\_routes\_destinations | List of CIDRs to be used as destination for static routes (used with `vpn_connection_static_routes_only = true`). Routes to destinations set here will be propagated to the routing tables of the subnets defined in `vpc_subnet_route_table_ids`. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| vpn\_connection\_static\_routes\_only | Set to true for the enabled VPN connection to use static routes exclusively (only if `enable_vpn_connection = true`). Static routes must be used for devices that don't support BGP. | `bool` | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| customer\_gateway\_id | The ID of the VPN Connection Route. |
| gateway\_attachment\_id | The ID of the Gateway Attachment. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |
| vpn\_connection\_id | The ID of the VPN Connection. |
| vpn\_gateway\_id | The ID of the VPN gateway. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
